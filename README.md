# AI for Medicine Specialization - TensorFlow v2 Notebooks

In October 2024, I began Coursera's [AI for Medicine Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine) and noticed that the course code was originally written for **TensorFlow v1**. In addition, only one of the validation images was included in the course materials.

To address these issues, I **rewrote the course notebooks** to support **TensorFlow v2**. I also took the opportunity to explore the material more deeply, going beyond the provided course content to extend and enhance the functionality of the original code.

## Improvements and Changes:
- Updated all code to be compatible with **TensorFlow v2**, making it more modern and easier to use.
- Added additional validation data and improved validation routines to give more comprehensive results.
- Expanded upon the course material with extra insights, experiments, and deeper dives into the concepts taught.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
